Pseudocode, on the other hand, is for humans.

By using Pseudocode, we don't start writing code from the beginning, but instead try to 
load the problem into our brain first.

When coding, there are two fundamental things going on:
1) The logical problem domain layer. <- Where Pseudocode is useful
2) The syntactical programming language layer. <- The actual programming language.

The problem with pseudocode, however, is that we cannot verify its logic.
