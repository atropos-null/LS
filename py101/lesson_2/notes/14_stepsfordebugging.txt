1) Reproduce the error.

Programmers need a deterministic way to reproduce the problem consistently, and only then 
can they start to isolate the root cause. 

2) Determine the boundaries of the error.

3) Trace the code.

4) Understand the problem well. 

5) Implement a fix. 

6) Fix one problem at a time. 

7) Text the fix.
