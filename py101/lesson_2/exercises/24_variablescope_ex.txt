1) Prints '5' once.

2) Prints '5' because the second variable isn't displayed. 

3) Prints '10'. 10 was set as the global within the function which reassigns
away from 5.

4) Prints 'Hello World'. While outer() is called, it doesn't actually display anything.

5) Error because its only a local variable.

6) Inner 1 takes the local variable but inner 2 doesn't have a new variable assigned
it takes the outer variable.
