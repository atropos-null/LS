1) a function that returns the sum of two numbers

START

SET FUNCTION NAME
GET variable X, INT 
GET variable Y, INT
x operator Y
RETURN result

END

2) a function that takes a list of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings 
concatenated together

START
SET FUNCTION NAME
SET list of strings
SET new string variable = list position 0, list position 1, etc etc
RETURN new string variable
END

3)a function that takes a list of integers, and returns a new list with every other element 
from the original list, starting with the first element. For instance:
every_other([1,4,7,2,5]) # => [1,7,5]

START
set name FUNCTION
GET list INT
RETURN LIST INT positions 0 2 4
END

4) a function that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of a given character in a 
string. For instance, if the given character is 'x' and the string is 'axbxcdxex', the 
function should return 6 (the index of the 3rd 'x'). If the given character does not occur 
at least 3 times, return None.

START
SET NAME FUNCTION
GET string
GET character
IF character > 2 times in a string, 
RETURN string[index]
ELSE RETURN None
END

5) a function that takes two lists of numbers and returns the result of merging the lists. 
The elements of the first list should become the elements at the even indexes of the 
returned list, while the elements of the second list should become the elements at the odd 
indexes. For instance: merge([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]) # => [1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6]

START
SET NAME FUNCTION
GET list 1
GET list 2
SET list 3: 
    ZIP list 1, list 2
    WHILE list 1 = index[0, 2, 4] AND list 2 index [1, 3, 5]
RETURN list 3
END
