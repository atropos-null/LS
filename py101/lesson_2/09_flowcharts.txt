Flow Chart Symbols:

Oval: Start/Stop
Rectangle: Processing Step
Parallelogram: Input/output
Diamond: Decision
Circle: Connector

Note that the decision (the diamond) components should only have two branches. If you have 
a decision with 3 (or more) branches, use separate diamonds for each branch.

Note that the arrows show the logic "flow" and that we're taking great pains to specify 
the iteration logic. That helps us map out the step-by-step logic our program would need 
to solve this problem. It's called the imperative or procedural way to solve a problem.
