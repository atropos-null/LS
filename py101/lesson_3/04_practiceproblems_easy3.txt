Question 5:

The following function unnecessarily uses two return statements to return boolean values. 
Can you rewrite this function so it only has one return statement and does not explicitly 
use either True or False?

def is_color_valid(color):
    if color == "blue" or color == "green":
        return True
    else:

Answer:

return color == "blue" or color == "green"

or 

return color in ["blue", "green"]
