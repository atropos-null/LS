1) Will it return the same results?

def first():
    return {
        'prop1': "hi there",
    }

def second():
    return
    {
        'prop1': "hi there",
    }
print(first())
print(second())

My answer: Yes

Actual Answer: In Python, the return statement ends the execution of a function and 
sends a value back to the caller. In the second function, the return statement is 
followed by a newline, so the function returns None before reaching the dictionary. 
Therefore, the two functions will not return the same results. 

return {

!=

return 
{
