1)  List the hidden files in a directory.
    ls -a

2)  List the files in the parent directory. Then list the files in the parent directory's parent directory.
    ls ..
    ls ../..

3)  What's the difference between abc/ and /abc?
    The difference between abc/ and /abc is in their paths:
        abc/ is a relative path. It refers to a directory named abc in the current working directory.
        /abc is an absolute path. It refers to a directory named abc at the root of the filesystem.

4)  What does ../abc mean?
    ../abc is a relative path that refers to a directory or file named abc in the parent directory of the current working directory.

5) Suppose you are in a directory with 7 files. You need to move 6 of them into a "tmp" directory, that you have yet to create. How do you do that?
    mkdir tmp
    mv file1 file2 file3 file4 file5 file6 tmp/
    mv !(file7) tmp/ <- This assumes you are using a shell that supports extended globbing, like Bash with shopt -s extglob enabled.

    or

    mkdir tmp
    mv * tmp/
    mv tmp/1.file ./

6)  Suppose you have two directories called xyz/ and abc/. How do you move all the files in abc/ that end with ".txt" into xyz/?
mv abc/*.txt xyz
