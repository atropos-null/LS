Problem: Write a function that takes a floating point number representing an angle between 0 and 360 degrees and returns 
a string representing that angle in degrees, minutes, and seconds. 
    - input: float between 0 and 360
    - output: angle as a string in degrees, minutes strings.
    - explicit rules: (Â°) to represent degrees, a single quote (') to represent minutes, and a double quote (") to represent seconds. 
    - implicit rules: There are 60 minutes in a degree, and 60 seconds in a minute.
    - Note: You can use the following constant to represent the degree symbol: DEGREE = "\u00B0"
