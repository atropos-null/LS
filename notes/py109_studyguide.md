the distinction between truthy and falsy values and the boolean values True and False
    Use "evaluates to true" or "is truthy" when discussing expressions that only have to be truthy.
    Use "evaluates to false" or "is falsy" when discussing expressions that only have to be falsy.
    Do not use "is True" or "is equal to True" unless you are specifically discussing the boolean value True.
    Do not use "is False" or "is equal to False" unless you are specifically discussing the boolean value False.

Parameters are the names assigned to a function's arguments; arguments are the values that get passed to the function.
Variables are not passed to or returned by functions: references to objects are passed.
Truthiness vs Boolean values (see above)
