print arguments:

sep='' : prints without spaces
end=   : what print() prints after it prints the last argument, often for compatibility with Windows
        (which sometimes needs a newline of \r\n) 

Finally, to start a new line immediately without printing anything else, just run print()

These both are the same: 
name = input("What's your name? ")
name = input("What's your name?\n")
