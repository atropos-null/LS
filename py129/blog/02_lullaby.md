# A Lullaby

What I hum to myself when the noise rises. You can stop here and not read any further.

## The Main Lullaby

> I know what I have

> Someone owns the next move

> Something else can be ignored

> One thing must be True

**I know what I have** -> inventory of what is present in the problem 

**Someone owns the next move**: what is the very next thing that has to be done. Only that very next thing. Which object owns it? 

**Something else can be ignored**: Only focus on the ONE thing. Tamp down the noise. Don't spiral.

**One thing must be True**: literally what has to be `True` for the thing to work.


## Algorithmic Lullaby

> What **stays** True?

> What shrinks each step?

> What must be True at the **end**?


## Object Collaboration Lullaby

> Objects hold state

> Methods move responsibility

> Calls pass time forward

> Nothing acts alone

## Dispatch Lullaby 

For dunder methods, operators etc

> Syntax knocks

> Dispatch decides

> Objects answer

> Protocols hold

If something surprises you, ask:

> Which object was asked?
