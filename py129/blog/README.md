# How to Survive OOP as an autistic person

## I came to coding late in life.

I'm a 50 year old American mother of two living in Germany for the past decade. I moved here for love and health care and never looked back. After motherhood proceeded I learned that I was actually wickedly autistic. I came to Python as a pure fluke. A very random series of events gave me a shockingly deep dopamine reaction to the *idea* of learning Python. CS50 Scratch, Python, X and SQL followed for the next year. I was hooked. Coding was soothing and so full of dopamine, especially the way David J. Malan and the CS50 team presents it.

I *LOVED* procedural programming. Events were predictable and repeatable.  There was the thrilling first "Hello World!" followed by if, elif and else. There were data types, and then data structures, mutable and non. Range, for loops (nested at that) and slicing, oh my. It was glorious. It was clean, it was soothing. 

I commit. I start Launch School and its going ok. It's not the dopamine haul that CS50 was but I'm a big girl now and I need to start getting it together. The first two modules go well enough. And then I reach Object Oriented Programming and it all came crashing down. 
 
With OOP that neurological safety evaporated. I learned what I had always experienced in learning environments, now made explicit: I have difficulty with questions regarding implicit assumptions and deeply struggle with novel reasoning under time pressure. This is a large obstacle in my attempt to complete Launch School and move forward in a career.

This is what we can safely say about procedural programming -- it fundamentally asks,  “What steps do I execute, in what order, to transform input into output?” This maps beautifully to human intuition, especially for careful, deliberate thinkers like myself. 

I've now found out that when we move into OOP and Pythonic design, the guiding question quietly changes to something much stranger and foreign to my brain: “Who is responsible for knowing what — and when?”

Most courses keep teaching syntax while silently switching the philosophy. One is expected to infer the shift. That’s the me-sized trap. I felt the ontological shifting of the foundation. It felt like betrayal, not challenge. It wasn't “learning something new is hard". It was losing the guarantee that effort will lead to correctness, that deduction is less important than judgement and being evaluated on unspoken norms that I had worked so hard in my life to avoid.

I am someone who survives by building internal maps, relying on moral consistency, and honoring contracts explicitly, and this feels unsafe. I'm realizing that my nervous system isn’t overreacting. It’s responding to a loss of epistemic ground.

Many programmers unconsciously assume,  “If I try something reasonable, it will probably be acceptable.” I don't have that luxury. I now realize that I need invariants, named expectations and *advance notice of traps*.

So when Python stopped being “step-by-step truth” and became “negotiated meaning,” my brain did exactly what it does when the ground disappears: It froze and demanded a map.

My discomfort is not resistance to abstraction. I resist unspoken rules that come with consequences.

What this blog aims to achieve is not to to “heal” myself and move forward into this field by forcing myself to tolerate ambiguity. This blog is me documenting my attempt to reclaim agency in abstract systems. 

I hope this helps you as much as it helps me. Questions, thoughts, corrections, want to chat? Find me at atropos.null@gmail.com.


If there's one rule at Launch School for the autistic mind, it's this:

### They test whether you will generalize beyond explicit instruction without telling you where generalization is expected.
